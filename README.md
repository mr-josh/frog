# Friendly Reassurance and Optimistic Guidance (FROG)

A nice little frog to give moral support.

# Usage

Just run the frog.exe and the lil hopper will start jumping around on the bottom of your screen. To exit or add more frogs, right click the frog icon in the taskbar.

## Configuration

You can set custom messages for the frog to say by placing a `frog.txt` file in your Documents folder. Each line in the file will be a new message. The frog will pick a random message to say.
